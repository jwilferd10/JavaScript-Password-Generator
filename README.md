## :wave: Description: 
<p> 
The JavaScript Password Generator is an app that quickly creates a randomized password based on the users parameters. Users must choose a length between 8Ô∏è‚É£ - 1Ô∏è‚É£2Ô∏è‚É£8Ô∏è‚É£ characters and will then be prompted with multiple questions through window.alert's to determine the parameters for the generated password. Finally users can copy their generated password onto their clipboard for quick and easy deployment.

This application should work just fine for mobile devices, for both desktop and mobile users can click on the center text area to start the program. Please, give it a try and generate a few passwords! Thanks so much for checking this Password Generator out, I hope this helps in anyway possible for all your ü§´ secretive needs. Happy Coding!
